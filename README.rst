This repository contains functions to store knowledge for the bot,
to use the knowledge stored by the bot to evaluate some statistics.

Remember to also checkout `mi-scheduler <https://github.com/thoth-station/mi-scheduler>`,
which schedules the workflows for thoth-station/mi project.

Pre-Usage
=========

.. code-block:: console

    pipenv install --dev

Usage - Create Bot Knowledge
============================

1. You can extract knowledge from a repository using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<github_acess_token> PYTHONPATH=. pipenv run srcopsmetrics/cli.py --repository <repo_name> -c

2. You can extract knowledge from a organization using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<github_acess_token> PYTHONPATH=. pipenv run srcopsmetrics/cli.py --organization <org_name> -c

Usage - Storing Knowledge
====================================

By default the cli will try to store the bot knowledge on Ceph.
In order to store on Ceph you need to provide the following env variables:

- `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` Ceph Host name where knowledge is stored.
- `CEPH_BUCKET` Ceph Bucket name where knowledge is stored.
- `CEPH_BUCKET_PREFIX` Ceph Prefix where knowledge is stored.
- `CEPH_KEY_ID` Ceph Key ID
- `CEPH_SECRET_KEY` Ceph Secret Key

If you want to test locally you have also the option to store locally without providing any parameter adding `-l` flag:

.. code-block:: console

    GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<github_acess_token> PYTHONPATH=. pipenv run srcopsmetrics/cli.py --repository <repo_name> -c -l

Usage - Visualize Project Statistics
====================================

.. code-block:: console

    PYTHONPATH=. pipenv run srcopsmetrics/cli.py --repository <repo_name> -v

.. code-block:: console

    PYTHONPATH=. pipenv run srcopsmetrics/cli.py --organization <org_name> -v

Examples
=========
For each repository is possible to obtain the following plots:

`MTTFR-in-time.png` --> Mean time to First Review (MTTFR) variation after each PR approved in time.

`MTTR-in-time.png` --> Mean time to Review (MTTR) variation after each PR approved in time.

`TTCI-in-time.png` --> Time to Close an Issue (TTCI) variation after each PR approved in time.

`TTFR-in-time.png` --> Time to First Review (TTFR) variation after each PR approved in time.

`TTR-in-time.png` --> Time to Review (TTR) variation after each PR approved in time.

`TTR-per-PR-length.png` --> Time to Review (TTR) variation after each PR length.

`TTR-per-PR.png` --> Time to Review (TTR) variation after each PR.

`TTFR-per-PR-length.png` --> Time to First Review (TTFR) variation after each PR length.

`TTFR-per-PR.png` --> Time to First Review (TTFR) variation after each PR.

Entity
======
Throughout the project, the objects with name "entities" are mentioned. Entity is essentialy a repository metadata that is being inspected during the process of analysis (e.g. Issue or Pull Request). Then, specified *features* are extracted from this entity and are saved as knowledge afterwards.

Entity Criteria
---------------

Any entity satisfies these criteria:

- schema for entity is available in `entity_schema.Schemas` class
- name of the entity is in the `enums.EntityTypeEnum` class
- name of the saved entities knowledge file is specified in `storage.KnowledgeStorage._FILENAME_ENTITY`
- method named `analyse_<entity_name>()` and its 'sub-part' method named `store_<entity_name>` is implemented in `github_knowledge.GitHubKnowledge` class. This concept of an `analyse` and `storage` method is used because of the GitHub pagination. These two methods are used in `iterator.KnowledgeAnalysis` context manager for *safe storage* saving, meaning that if any exception of type `GithubException` or `KeyboardInterrupt` raises during the process of iterating through paginated lists, the context manager tries to save the already analysed (cached) knowledge that should be in valid state (by comparing it to the defined schema in `entity_schema.Schemas`). This saves time, resources and also the GitHub API rate limit.
- method `analyse_entity` is then called in `bot_knowledge.analyse_projects` with entity enum from `enums.EntityTypeEnum` passed as a parameter.

Usage - Reviewer Reccomender
============================

.. code-block:: console

    PYTHONPATH=. pipenv run srcopsmetrics/cli.py --project <project_name> -r True

If there are bots in the list of contributors of your project you can add them to the list
at the beginning of the file. In this way you can receive the percentage of the work
done by humans vs bots.

.. code-block:: console

    BOTS_NAMES = [
        "sesheta",
        "dependencies[bot]",
        "dependabot[bot]",
        ]

`number_reviewer` flag is set to 2

Final Score for Reviewers assignment
=====================================

The final score for the selection of the reviewers, it is based on the following
contributions. (Number of reviewers is by default 2, but it can be changed)

1. Number of PR reviewed respect to total number of PR reviewed by the team.

2. Mean time to review a PR by reviewer respect to team repostiory MTTR.

3. Mean length of PR respect to minimum value of PR length for a specific label.

4. Number of commits respect to the total number of commits in the repository.

5. Time since last review compared to time from the first review of the project respect to the present time.
(Time dependent contribution)

Each of the contribution as a weight factor k. If all weight factors are set to 1,
all contributions to the final score have the same weight.

How to contribute
=================
Always feel free to open new Issues or engage in already existing ones!

I want to add new Entity
------------------------
If you want to contribute by adding new entity that will be analysed from GitHub repositories and stored as a knowledge,
your implementation has to meet with Entity criteria described above. Always remember to first create Issue and describe
why do you think this new entity should be analysed and stored and what are the benefits of doing so according to the goal
of thoth-station/mi project. Do not forget to reference the Issue in your Pull Request.
